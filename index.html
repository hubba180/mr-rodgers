    <h4>Dear <span id="name"></span>,</h4>
    <p>I'm so happy to see you have an interest in numbers because I love them too. They always come in so many different shapes and sizes, kind of like people. The more numbers we know the more we can accomplish with them. Remember it's okay if some of those numbers confuse you like this: <br><span id="output"></span><br> Did you know my favorite number is 143? It means 'I love you' because 1 = one, 4 = l-o-v-e, and 3 = y-o-u! I hope you'll think of me now whenever you come across that number.</p>
